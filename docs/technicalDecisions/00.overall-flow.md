# How this project works?
There are two different Bounded Contexts:
1. `src/Ingestor`
2. `src/Catalog`

First one is about ingesting the data from our external provider and transforming it into a format that we can use in our system. 
The second one is about exposing the data to our clients through an API. 
This separation of concerns allows us to have a clear and maintainable codebase, where each Bounded Context is responsible for a specific part of the system.

## The `Ingestor` bounded context
### Description
When the app runs for the first time (after running the `make build` command), it executes the `apps/SymfonyClient/src/CLI/ActivitiesIngestor.php` command.
This command fetches from the external provider all entertainment events, normalizes them and stores in the BC database.

When an entertainment event is stored, the BC emits a Domain event to notify the `Catalog` context about the change.
